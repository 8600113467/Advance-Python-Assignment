    "\n",
    "**ANS:** An abstract superclass is a class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that is designed to be a blueprint or template for other classes but is not meant to be instantiated itself.It often contains common attributes and methods that are shared by multiple subclasses.Abstract superclasses may include methods that are meant to be overridden by subclasses, providing a common interface that derived classes must implement.In Python, you can create an abstract superclass by using the ABC (Abstract Base Class)module and defining abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator. Subclasses of an abstract superclass must implement these abstract methods."

    "**ANS:** When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement (an assignment outside of any method), it defines a class-level attribute.\n",
    "This class-level attribute is shared among all instances of the class, and it can be accessed using both the class name and instance name.\n",
