    "\n",
    "**ANS:** In Python, when an exception is raised (either a built-in exception or a custom exception class), the Python interpreter searches for an appropriate exception handler to process the exception. The matching process is based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of the raised exception: Python compares the type of the raised exception (the exception class) with the types specified in the except clauses of try-except blocks. It tries to find the first except block whose exception type matches the raised exception or a base class of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of except clauses: Python evaluates except clauses from top to bottom. The first matching except block encountered is the one that will handle the exception. This is why it's important to order your except clauses from the most specific (subclasses) to the most general (base classes) to ensure that the correct handler is chosen.\n",

    "\n",
    "**ANS:** In modern Python programming, it is recommended not to use string-based exceptions for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Clarity: String-based exceptions are less clear and informative than exception classes. When you use a string to represent an exception, it doesn't provide any structured information about the nature of the error, making it difficult to understand the cause of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Exception Handling: String-based exceptions make it challenging to handle exceptions effectively because you can't use the exception's type to differentiate between different types of errors. This limits your ability to implement specific error-handling logic for different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incompatibility: String-based exceptions are considered outdated and are not compatible with modern exception handling mechanisms in Python, such as try-except blocks with exception classes or custom exception hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve code readability, maintainability, and robustness, it is recommended to use exception classes (either built-in or custom) to represent and handle exceptions in Python. This approach allows you to provide clear and structured information about the error and enables more precise error handling."
