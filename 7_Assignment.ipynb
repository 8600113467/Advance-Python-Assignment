    "Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANS:** The purpose of the try statement in many programming languages, including Python, is to define a block of code where exceptions (errors) may occur. It allows you to handle exceptions gracefully by providing a mechanism to catch and respond to them without causing the program to crash. The try statement is typically followed by one or more except blocks that specify how to handle different types of exceptions that may be raised within the try block."

    "**ANS:** The two most popular variations of the try statement are:\n",
    "\n",
    "try-except: This variation allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions that may occur within the try block. You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "try-finally: This variation ensures that a specific block of code (the \"finally\" block) is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. It's commonly used for cleanup tasks, like closing files or releasing resources."

    "Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANS:** The raise statement is used to explicitly raise an exception in a program. It allows you to trigger an exception at a specific point in your code, providing a way to signal exceptional conditions or errors. You can specify the type of exception to raise and, optionally, provide an error message or additional context. For example, you can use raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\") to raise a ValueError exception with the message \"Invalid input.\""

    "Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANS:** The assert statement is used to test whether a given condition is true, and if it's not true, it raises an AssertionError exception. It is typically used for debugging and testing purposes to check if certain conditions in the code are met. If the condition provided to the assert statement evaluates to False, an exception is raised, indicating that something unexpected has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assert statement is similar in function to the if statement, but it is used specifically for asserting that acondition holds true during development and testing. It is not meant for handling exceptions or errors in production code but rather for identifying and debugging issues during development."

    "Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANS:** The with/as statement in Python is used for resource management, specifically for ensuring that resources (such as files, network connections, or database connections) are properly acquired and released. It is often used in conjunction with context managers, which define the behavior of entering and exiting a context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the with/as statement is to simplify resource management by eliminating the need to explicitly open and close resources. The with statement creates a context where the resource is acquired when entering the block and automatically released when exiting the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with/as statement is similar in purpose to the try-finally statement, as both are used for resource cleanup. However,the with/as statement provides a more concise and Pythonic way of achieving the same result, especially when working with context managers."
