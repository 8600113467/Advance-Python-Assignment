    "Indexing and slicing are two fundamental operations for accessing elements in sequences (like lists, strings, and tuples) in Python. Here are the key distinctions between indexing and slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing:**\n",
    "Purpose: Indexing is used to access a single element at a specific position within a sequence.\n",
    "Syntax: It is done using square brackets with the index enclosed, e.g., my_list[3] or my_string[0].\n",
    "Result: Indexing returns the individual element at the specified index.\n",
    "Index Range: Valid indices range from 0 to len(sequence) - 1 for positive indexing and from -1 to -len(sequence) for negative indexing.\n",
    "Example: my_list[3] would access the fourth element of the list (assuming 0-based indexing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing:**\n",
    "Purpose: Slicing is used to create a new subsequence by extracting a range of elements from the original sequence.\n",
    "Syntax: It involves specifying a start, stop, and optional step within square brackets, e.g., my_list[1:4] or my_string[::2].\n",
    "Result: Slicing returns a new sequence containing elements from the specified range.\n",
    "Index Range: The start index is inclusive, and the stop index is exclusive. The step value determines how elements are selected within the specified range.\n",
    "Example: my_list[1:4] would create a new list with elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 from the original list.\n",
    "In summary, indexing retrieves a single element at a specific position, while slicing extracts a subsequence of elements from a specified range within the sequence. Understanding and using these operations effectively is crucial for working with sequences in Python."

    "**Graph Theory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In graph theory, an \"unbalanced matrix\" could refer to an adjacency matrix of a directed graph where the in-degrees and out-degrees of nodes (vertices) are not equal. In a directed graph, the in-degree of a node is the number of incoming edges, and the out-degree is the number of outgoing edges. If there are nodes with different in-degrees and out-degrees, the matrix representing these relationships could be considered \"unbalanced.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Algebra:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of linear algebra, an \"unbalanced matrix\" could refer to a matrix that does not have an equal number of rows and columns. Normally, matrices are square (having the same number of rows and columns) or rectangular (having different numbers of rows and columns). An \"unbalanced matrix\" might be a term used informally to describe a rectangular matrix, especially when discussing operations like matrix multiplication where the dimensions of the matrices need to be compatible.\n",

    "**Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Unlike some programming languages where you can statically allocate memory for arrays or matrices of a predefined size, Python lists (and matrices implemented as lists of lists) are dynamically sized. This means that Python lists can grow or shrink as needed. When you create a list, Python allocates memory for it dynamically, and it doesn't require you to specify the size upfront.\n",

    "**Flexibility:** Python is designed to be a flexible and dynamic language, allowing you to work with data structures of varying sizes.
