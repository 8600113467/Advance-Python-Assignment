    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to facilitate the organization and structure of code by modeling real-world objects and their interactions using objects and classes. OOP is a programming paradigm that encourages the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent data and behavior in a modular and reusable way. "

    "In Python, when you access an attribute (such as a method or variable) of an object, the inheritance search looks for that attribute in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance Namespace:- It first checks if the attribute is present in the instance itself. If found, it is used.\n",
    "Class Namespace:-   If the attribute is not found in the instance, it looks in the class of the instance. If found, it is used.\n",
    "Base Classes (Superclasses):- If the attribute is not found in the class, Python searches through the class's base classes\n",
    "(superclasses) in a depth-first, left-to-right order until it finds the attribute or reaches the top of the inheritance hierarchy (usually the base class called object)."

The purpose of __init__ is to initialize the attributes and state of the newly created instance.
