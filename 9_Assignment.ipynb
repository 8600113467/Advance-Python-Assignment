    "In Unicode, the first 128 code points (0 to 127) are assigned to the same characters as ASCII, making ASCII text a valid subset of Unicode text.

    "Q8. How much of an effect does the change in string types in Python 3.X have on your code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANS:** The change in string types from Python 2.X to Python 3.X, specifically the introduction of Unicode strings (str) as the default string type, can have a significant impact on your code. The degree of impact depends on various factors, including the nature of your code, the character encodings you work with, and how well you manage the transition. Here are some of the effects and considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding and Decoding:** In Python 3.X, you need to be more explicit about encoding and decoding when working with text data. This means you must use methods like encode() and decode() to convert between str (Unicode) and bytes (binary) representations. Code that assumes ASCII or default encodings may need adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compatibility:** Code that relies on Python 2.X's str type (which is bytes) for text data may need updates to use Python 3.X's str type (Unicode). This includes ensuring that your code can handle a wider range of characters and is not limited to ASCII.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Print Statements:** Print statements in Python 3.X require parentheses around the printed text (e.g., print(\"Hello\") instead of print \"Hello\"). Old-style print statements need to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Functions:** In Python 3.X, the input() function returns a str object (Unicode), while in Python 2.X, it returned a str object (bytes). If your code relies on specific behavior related to user input, it may need adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterating Over Strings:** Iterating over a str in Python 3.X iterates over Unicode code points, not bytes. If your code depends on byte-level iteration, you may need to use the bytes type.\n",
    "\n",
    "File I/O: When reading/writing files, you must specify the encoding (or use binary mode 'b') explicitly in Python 3.X. Code that assumes default encodings may encounter Unicode-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Libraries and Dependencies:** Check whether third-party libraries and dependencies you use are compatible with Python 3.X. Some older libraries may need updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**String Literals:** String literals in your code (e.g., \"text\") are Unicode by default in Python 3.X, while they were bytes in Python 2.X. This can affect operations like concatenation with bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling of Non-ASCII Characters:** Ensure that your code correctly handles non-ASCII characters, especially when processing or displaying text from different languages and character sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing:** Thoroughly test your code in a Python 3.X environment to identify and fix any compatibility issues.\n"
